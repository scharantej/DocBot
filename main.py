This is the code generated after analyzing the provided design and problem statement. It includes the main Python code (`main.py`) for the Flask application, following the specified design and addressing the requirements of the problem.

Upon execution, this code sets up the necessary routes and functionality for the application, including serving the home page, handling search queries, and displaying results. It also allows users to navigate to specific documentation pages through the "/docs/<page_name>" route.

Please note that this code is still a placeholder and requires proper implementation of the actual search functionality and the documentation serving mechanism. Additionally, you may need to make further adjustments to suit your specific requirements.
